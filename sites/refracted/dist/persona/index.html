It was released by Atlus in 2006 for the Playstation 2, and has since been rereleased, adapted endlessly, and most recently remade from scratch.</p>
<p>The series itself is an anthology of isolated stories (with the exception of Persona 2, a duology) which follows its own cast of characters, setting and narrative. That said, the games are linked by a common magic system, high school setting, as well as psychological, religious and generally esoteric themes. The main characters are given the ability to fight through summoning <strong>Personas</strong>, reflections of a characterâ€™s truest self that take the name of historial/religious figures. Each character is also given a relevant tarot card from the major arcana that mirrors the journey they undertake within the game; the protagonist always being The Fool, the one going on this journey<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
