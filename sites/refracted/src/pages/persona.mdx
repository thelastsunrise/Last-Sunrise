*Persona 3*, ironically the fourth installment in the Persona series, is a JRPG-meets-social-simulator that tackles death, mortality and grief in all its forms. It was released by Atlus in 2006 for the Playstation 2, and has since been rereleased, adapted endlessly, and most recently remade from scratch.

The series itself is an anthology of isolated stories (with the exception of Persona 2, a duology) which follow their own cast of characters, settings and narratives. That said, the games are linked by a common magic system, high school setting, as well as psychological, religious and generally esoteric themes. The main characters are given the ability to fight through summoning **Personas**, reflections of a character's truest self that take the name of historial/religious figures. Each character is also given a relevant tarot card from the major arcana that mirrors the journey they undertake within the game; the protagonist always being the Fool, the one going on this journey<sup>[1]</sup>.

### The Beginning
Persona 3 opens with the player character, Makoto Yuki<sup>[2]</sup> moving into his new dorm the night before transferring to a new school, Gekkoukan High School. As the clock hits 12 AM, the world shifts: the sky becomes green, the people around him turn into coffins, all electronics are shut down, and ground is littered with pools of blood.

He reaches the dorm, only to be greeted by a kid, Pharos, asking for him to sign a contract.

> Time never waits.
> It delivers all equally to the same end. I hereby agree to the statement above, and I chooseth this fate of mine own free will.

Pharos vanishes, and Makoto meets two of his new dorm-mates, including Mitsuru Kirijo, right after. He soon finds out that this dorm is home to a club known as the **Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad**, or SEES for short. Their purpose is to eliminate the **Dark Hour**, the extra, nonexistent hour of time Makoto experienced on his way to the dorm, and the **Shadows** that threaten to destroy the world within it. Stranger yet, during the Dark Hour, Gekkoukan High School turns into a labyrinthine tower called **Tartarus**, which SEES also exists to investigate (and is why it exists as a school club and not an external taskforce).

Shadows are born of human consciousness, and are amalgamations of all suppressed thoughts, feelings and desires humanity feels. They're mirrors to Personas in that way: where Personas are facets of the self that have been accepted, Shadows are the ones that have been ignored and repressed. While they generally stay in Tartarus during the Dark Hour, every full moon a Greater one, representing any one of the first 12 major Arcana, will appear somewhere in town and cause mayhem.

Within that first week of living there, the first full moon arrives and the Magician attacks the dorm. Makoto awakens to his Persona, Orpheus, but something...odd happens too.

When Makoto was all alone, face to face with the Magician, it was Pharos who appeared in his mind's eye and told him to activate his power. After it's done, Thanatos, a whole other persona, rips itself out of Orpheus and rends the Shadow apart before vanishing. Everyone is confused about this, but without answers, the only thing they know for fact is that Makoto has something unique going on with his power. And the player knows that Pharos has something to do with this power.

### Fool's Journey
Leading up to a full moon, more and more people become victims to **Apathy Syndrome**, which is what happens when a person not in coffin form is attacked by a Shadow. They lose all interest in living, and can only stumble around in place, needing to be cared for by others.

Apathy Syndrome cases specifically decrease after the defeat of a major Shadow, which leads SEES (which gains new members as the game progresses) to realize all twelve of these Shadows need to be defeated to end the Dark Hour, as is confirmed by their club advisor, Shuji Ikutsuki, a scientist who works with Mitsuru's family, **the Kirijo Group**, to study the nature of Personas and Shadows.

At this point, Pharos visits Makoto around once or twice a month, exclusively during the Dark Hour, to speak about his slowly-returning memories, and of the imminent end of the world.

Except... Ikutsuki never had SEES or the world's best interests in mind. After defeating the twelfth Shadow, the Hanged Man, the group finds out he fabricated the story about defeating the Shadows of the Arcana. It won't end the Dark Hour, but actually bring about the end of the world by fusing the entity known as Death.

Around this time, Pharos visits Makoto for the final time, saying he knows his purpose and that this will be the last time they meet.

1. In Persona 1 and 2, the protagonists are not the Fool, but rather different cards in the major Arcana.
2.  The P3 Hero has no single canon name. He's otherwise known as Minato Arisato (manga) and Sakuya Shiomi (stageplay), but I'll be sticking with Yuki on this website.
