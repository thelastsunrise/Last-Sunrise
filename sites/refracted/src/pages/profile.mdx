Ryoji is a fragment of Death, and the physical embodiment of the Death Arcana. He takes multiple forms throughout the game, some by choice and others not, due to his nature as a god. Despite his minor role and scarce presence in any sort of marketing material, he's one of, if not *the* most pivotal characters in the game.

We first meet him as Pharos, a creepy child who appears to Makoto periodically during the dark hour, and who prompts him to unlock the power of Persona. Pharos leaves after all his missing pieces are returned to him, and is "reborn" as a living, breathing human, Ryoji. Though, he doesn't know this.

That incarnation, the same one this site is themed after, also the one most commonly seen in the fandom, only appears in the game for two months, from November and just barely through December. There's lots of reasons as to why people gravitate towards this version of him, but for me I feel as though Ryoji best encapsulates the message this character exists to express.

Ryoji is Death if he was able to live and love and breathe his own cruelty. He falls in love with the world and every single person in it, and then has to reconcile with being the reason the world will come to an end.

He also appears in more "monstrous" forms, through Thanatos and the Nyx Avatar, the former being his true self, and the latter being the shell of Ryoji, dead and twisted apart into a vessel to usher the end of the world.
