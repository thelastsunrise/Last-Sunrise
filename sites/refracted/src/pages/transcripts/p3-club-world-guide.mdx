description: "An excerpt from the P3 Club Book published in 2006, this interview between some of the characters in Persona 3 explains some really interesting worldbuilding concepts about not only P3, but the series as whole! It presents information that would later be used in P3FES's The Answer, P4, P4AU and P5. It's a hefty read, but one that explains a lot of otherwise vague and unaddressed concepts throughout the entire series-especially ones regarding Nyx and Ryoji's existence."

The spectacular world and lore of Persona 3 are a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Join a host of familiar faces from P3 as they help answer any and all questions you might have!

**Shuji Ikutsuki ("S"):** Welcome to Shuji Ikutsuki...

**Aigis ("A"):** and Aigis's...

**S & A:** anything-goes *P3* Q&A!

**S:** I'm here today as a distinguished Shadow researcher and chairman of the board at Gekkoukan High School. I'm joined by...

**A:** Aigis--a tactical humanoid weapon deployed for anti-Shadow combat. Together, we'll provide answers to any and all questions you may have. But, Ikutsuki-san...

**S:** Hm? What is it, Aigis?

**A:** Correct me if 'm mistaken, but didn’t you die after falling from the observatory?

**S:** Don't be silly, Aigis. Unlike the real me from the game, this me is a talking head brought in for the purposes of answering questions That means resurrection is fair game. My personality’s a little different, too. I hope you don’t mind too much.

**A:** A different personality... Does that mean
you won'’t be making puns anymore?

**S:** Oh, I will be.

**A:** Tch.

**S:** A-Aigis... I don’t remember you being the
type of girl to click her tongue...

**A:** Why don’t we cut the crap and get on with
the discussion. Or would you like this Five-Barreled Medusa to start spraying lead?

**S:** Hmm... I don’t think I'm up for a chest full of
bullets. Alright then, let’s kick it off with our first
question!

**Q: Without mincing words, what is Nyx's true identity?**

**S:** To talk about that, | must first tell an old tale.
Long, long ago, in ancient times, there existed a
massive life form the size of a planet drifting dormant through outer space. One day this lifeform,
known also as a “planet eater,” collided with Earth,
where life had only just taken root. The probability
of that impact must have been one in a billion—no,
one in a trillion. At any rate, it marked the first contact between Nyx and life on Earth.

**A:** So Nyx was born in outer space? I'm surprised
the Earth didn’t crumble then and there.

**S:** That's because the materials from which Nyx
is composed operate under a different set of physical laws than those that govern Earth. Even so, the
impact of the collision was violent and immense.
The shock broke off a fragment of the Earth, which
flew into the sky to become the moon. Nyx’s vibrational essence—her spirit—remained with the
planet, while her physical essence—her
flesh—resided with the moon. But it was her spirit
that was the more dangerous of the two. You see,
the vibrations it emitted were capable of annihilating all life on earth. Needless to say, Earth’s creatures, primeval as they were, cherished life instinctively, and managed to resist Nyx’s deadly vibrations. And so life persisted. It evolved explosively, and in time acquired a weapon with which it could oppose Nyx. This weapon is what psychologists commonly refer to as the “collective unconscious”—the shared informational domain of all
life on Earth.

**A:** But...how is that a weapon? Was it some kind
of supernatural power they used to beat Nyx
down?

**S:** No, no. Those living on Earth managed to seal
Nyx away in their collective unconscious. The driving force behind her containment was “repression,” which stemmed from a fear of death and a
desire to keep on living. One can’t deny the irony
that it was Nyx, an entity meant to embody death,
who spurred Earth’s life to evolve such complex
mental faculties. In Greek mythology, Nyx is depicted as a goddess. Perhaps man was aware to
some extent, all those ages past, that she was in fact the mother of life.

**A:** That’s quite profound.

**S:** Now that I think about it, it's thanks to Nyx I
can say all these rad puns.

**A:** And for that I'll never forgive her.

**S:** You wound me, Aigis... Anyway, as long as
living things—especially humans with powerful
and complex mental faculties—fear death, Nyx
should continue to be sealed away in their collective unconscious. Of course, we had a very close
call with that during the game. Just when Nyx
was about to be restored and wreak havoc, she
was once again sealed away by the power of the
Universe your leader obtained. Tsk, tsk. What a
waste,

**A:** Even after dying, you still haven’t learned
your lesson... By the way, what happened to
Nyx’s “body”?

**S:** After assimilating with the moon, Nyx’s body
gradually began repairing itself, healing the
wounds it had sustained from the impact of the
collision. By the time the game takes place, I suspect that process was all but complete. But because it was no more than a husk, all it could do was wait idly until the seal on its spirit was lifted.
This is precisely what happened, and after the
battle with Nyx Avatar, it was summoned to descend by its unshackled spirit. But after the spirit
was once again sealed away, it quietly went back to being the moon again.

**Q: What exactly was the fall Nyx was supposed to bring about?**

**A:** Yes, what was it?

**S:** As I said before, Nyx’s spiritual form has been
sealed away in our unconscious. Liberation from
that bondage would mean her freedom. She
would reunite with the moon her flesh had
become and regain her true form, ushering in the
Fall and ensuring Earth’s doom. As a matter of
fact, this event has come near to transpiring several times throughout Earth’s history.

**A:** Truly?

**S:** Think about when a huge war breaks out or a deadly epidemic starts to spread. Thoughts of the
end times start taking hold in people’s minds.
They grow tired of living. They can’t stand to do it
anymore. Such ideas weaken the force that pins
Nyx down—people’s fear of death—and, ironically, serves to bring Nyx's liberation closer, along
with the doom her release would entail. The
“book of prophecy” I mentioned during the game
is a chronicle of the apocalypse as it appeared in
various eras throughout history, and with the
hints it provided, I was able to discover a means
by which Nyx could be liberated. Pretty amazing,
huh?

**A:** Amazing...ly evil.

**S:** Your words are more harmful than any
bullet...

**A:** But...how did people manage to stave off the
apocalypse back when S.E.E.S wasn’t around?

**S:** Ah, an excellent question. Well, for starters,
when you only have hundreds or thousands of
people praying for the end, Nyx’s seal will just
be partially weakened. After all, it’s not often you
get a huge number of people all wishing for
death. Moreover, humans have created a conceptual apparatus within their unconscious that
opposes Nyx, and with it have fortified their own
psyches.

**A:** This is complex stuff.

**S:** In a word, that apparatus is “mythology.”
Most times, it depicts a beneficent deity vanquishing an evil one and saving the world from
ruin. The existence of these deities has helped
stabilize our unconscious repression and
strengthened the seal on Nyx. However, in our
modern age, with all its scientific and technological advances, its impact has diminished.
Quite the opposite, religion now sometimes
drives people *toward* apocalyptic ideology. Especially in a society with such sophisticated information technology as ours, a fractional trend
toward armageddon, which would otherwise
constitute no more than a local phenomenon,
can sweep across the globe in the blink of an
eye. The apocalypse in this game originated
from Kirijo’s experiment, but even without that
impetus, it's possible the end wasn't far off.
Yes... Perhaps this weekend...would have been
the world’s end.

**A:** You know, this Kiss of Athena sprays lead,
too.

**S:** Oh, you're ice cold. Shall I summon Nyx again?

**Q: What are Shadows?**

**S:** They're what follow you on sunny days.

**A:** Not that kind of shadow. \*Bang!*

**S:** Ouch, Aigis! Fine. To answer your question
seriously, Shadows are pieces of Nyx.

**A:** So they aren't like her minions or children?

**S:** Remember how I explained earlier that Nyx
is being suppressed in the depths of our collective unconscious? What that means is that
Nyx exists deep within the psyche of every
living thing—on a level below the unconscious.

**A:** I’'m with you so far.

**S:** So imagine if a certain living thing—lori,
for instance—were to say, “I got a zero on the
test. What's the point in living anymore!?” and
stopped resisting Nyx in his unconscious?
What do you suppose would happen?

**A:** guess Nyx would come slithering out of
his heart.

**S:** That's right. More precisely, a piece of Nyx would break free of his unconscious.
That piece of Nyx—of her spiritual form—is in fact
what we call a Shadow.

**A:** For something that’s part of Nyx, it sure is
runty.

**S:** That's because it’s just a tiny, infinitesimal
piece of her. Aside from a few special abilities
and an immunity to conventional physical attacks owing to their spiritual nature, Shadows
don’t possess much power at all. However, to
the life forms who harbor them, Shadows are
very important indeed.

**A:** How so?

**S:** Well, because it's their fate to carry a Shadow-a fragment of Nyx—deep within
their psyche, all living things on Earth necessarily have a limited lifespan.

**A:** But aren’t living things thought to have a
lifespan ordinarily?

**S:** That is the prevailing knowledge held by
those on Earth today. But think of the primordial life forms that existed on this planet long
ago. Organisms like amoebas, for example,
could grow repeatedly and indefinitely by
means of cellular division, and did not die
unless eaten by another creature. As I explained earlier, Nyx served to promote an evolutionary explosion, but the cost that came
with it was a limited lifespan. It's also important to note that the Shadows incorporated into
living things’ psyches are themselves an important component of our mental makeup.
Losing this fragment is equivalent to losing
one’s psyche altogether—especially for organisms like humans with a sophisticated
psychic constitution.

**A:** So is that why...?

**S:** Exactly. The reason why Shadow people—humans who've succumbed to Apathy
Syndrome—became like empty shells is because they’ve lost the Shadow—the fragment
of Nyx—that was contained within their psyche.

**A:** Now I understand.

**Q: What exactly does it mean to be "eaten by a Shadow"?**

**S:** I think we already know the answer to this
one. It isn't that Shadows actually eat
humans. Rather, humans give rise to Shadows, and, as a result, shell-like Shadow
people can emerge. However, when we witness the phenomenon of a person being
drawn into the Dark Hour, their Shadow enveloping them, and that person succumbing to
Apathy Syndrome, it appears as though their
psyche is being eaten. During the game, Yamagishi’s close friend Natsuki heard the “call of
the Shadows,” but this voice also belonged to
the Shadow in her heart. Those who forget that
death lurks inside them and live without purpose will stray into the Dark Hour as their
Shadow desires, and thereupon be reduced to
a husk. Scary stuff, huh? However, Natsuki's
case is unique in that her experience inside the
Dark Hour restored her will to resist death,
which is why she didn’t end up becoming a
Shadow person. Though they’re incredibly
rare, such people do exist. Humans truly are
something!

**A:** Are you finished yet? On to the next question.

**S:** (Sob)... You know, questions aren't the
only thing that can be broken down.

**Q: What are the Shadows even after?**

**A:** Even *I* know the answer to this one. They
want to bring back Nyx. Except, according to
you, the Shadows already are Nyx...

**S:** Indeed they are. So technically speaking,
their main goal is to return to prime Nyx—Nyx
as she's meant to be. Having been reduced to
small shards of her power, their first recourse
is to try fusing with other shards—their fellow
Shadows. Whenever a certain number of Shad-
ows manage to combine, they take a step
toward returning to full power as prime Nyx.

**A:** Come to think of it, those powerful Greater
Shadows that appeared whenever there was a
full moon were created artificially by assembling Shadows during Kirijo’s experiment. So
does that mean...?

**S:** Exactly. And they can form without being
assembled forcibly. If uncertainty girdles the
globe and apocalyptic ideology spreads, Great-
er Shadows will appear on their own—though
it may take some time. In turn, these will fuse
and eventually bring about Nyx’s resurrection.
After all, that’s the reason they exist.

**A:** Hmph. And *we* exist to put those Shadows
down.

**S:** Which is why you’re so unwelcome to
them. I said earlier that Shadows don’t actually eat humans, but on rare occasions they
will attack those who can wield Personas.
That’s because they possess intelligence of
their own, and recognize the obstacle Persona users might pose to Nyx’s return. Also
rarely, Shadows will sometimes attack
Adapters who wander into the Dark Hour. In
those cases, they’re trying to forcibly fuse
with the Shadows repressed deep in those
people’s psyches.

**A:** That's quite crafty of them.

**S:** Isn’'t it? And when you think about it,
aren’t Shadows kind of cute looking?

**A:** Out of curiosity, when was your last eye
exam?

**Q: What meaning is there behind the various Shadow Arcana?**

**A:** The Shadow Arcana are classified by
tarot cards ranging from number zero—the
Fool—to number twelve—the Hanged Man.

**S:** As I recall, you learned in class that tarot
cards represent stages of human growth,
correct? Shadow classification works in a
similar manner, with each stage symbolizing
a certain psychic inclination.

**A:** So the higher the number, the stronger
the Shadow?

**S:** Hmm... It's a little more nuanced than
that. It’s true that the higher the number, the
more well-developed and formidable they
are, but each also constitutes an important
aspect of Nyx’s whole. When all of these
shadows and their unique tendencies are
combined, they transform into Arcana
number thirteen—Death. This Death Arcana
is special. As implied by its alias—the harbinger of the Fall—Death signifies that the
stage is set for Nyx’s return.

**A:** That would be Ryoji-san. Honestly, he
was a bit of a pervert, but his loss hit hard.

**Ryoji Mochizuki (“R”):** You called?

**A:** Brighid’s Flame!

**S:** Yowch! Hot, hot, hot! Seriously, why’s
a cute girl like you carrying around such a mean weapon?

**A:** Shut up and die like a man.

**R:** Settle down, you two. I'll take it from here. So, the special thing about Death is that he shares the will and abilities of Nyx's spiritual form. He's an incarnation of Nyx-hence, "Nyx Avatar." That makes me, quite literally, the Grim Reaper. You know what comes next. Death calls forth Nyx's flesh, which has assimilated with the moon, and the two unite, becoming a "planet eater" capable of sowing destruction on a global scale. A sad outcome indeed. But my friend came to the rescue. He used the Universe as a foil and plunged me once more into the depths of the collective unconscious. I knew he had it in him.

**A:** Hm? Could it be you're happy the Fall was averted?

**R:** Well, the less said about that the better. Anyway, I'm off.

**A:** Ah... Gone already. Surprisingly nice, isn't he? Hm? What's wrong, Ikutsuki-san?

**S:** (Sob)... He took the joy of explaining everything away from me...
