### Mistic
Mistic is Ryoji's primary leitmotif in all game releases of Persona 3. It's a stripped-back version of the Tartarus theme, one that sounds more ethereal and somber (where Tartarus' arrangements are more triumphant, building with every block you ascend). The main melody of this arrangement is played by a piano, with synths as its harmony. There's a ticking snare in the back, similar to a clock, and periodic drumbeats that evoke a heart's beat.

It's most notably heard in any scene featuring Ryoji after he learns of his nature, over the final sequence and credits after getting the bad ending, and in the Sea of Souls segment with the rest of SEES after the Nyx Avatar boss fight. It plays a couple more times, in smaller scenes during December and January where SEES discusses Ryoji and the world's end.

#### Determination
Mistic can also be heard in the tail end of the song Determination, which is an even more stripped back version of its original. The only two instruments in this version are the cello's melody and piano's accents.

This song plays specifically during the final cutscene of the Nyx fight, when Makoto enters the Nyx Core.

This song, with its absence of the "clock" and "heartbeat" from its arrangement, are more accurately a representation of Makoto sacrificing his life: rising beyond the passage of time and letting go of his body. But with how tightly woven his character is to Ryoji's it can also representative of him joining back with him in death.

### Linked Episode Tracks
Ryoji's linked episodes in *Persona 3 Reload* follow him as he learns to play and appreciate music in an effort to connect with Makoto. Below are the raw audio files of both his piano performances and the music box he buys (and eventually gives) to the protagonist.
