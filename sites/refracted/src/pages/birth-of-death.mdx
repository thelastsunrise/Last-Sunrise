Before humanity, there was an entity known as Nyx, the Planet Eater, who crashed into Earth and was split apart in spirit and body. Her spirit remained in the main chunk of the earth, while her physical form mixed with the fractured chunks of Earth to create the moon. In fact, her spirit gave the then-single celled and functionally immortal lifeforms the ability to die over the course of time

But, her spirit also expedited the evolutionary process: particularly in what would become humanity. Humans formed psyches and consciousnesses, they gained the ability to think and feel for themselves in a way beyond just instinct. They learned to fear death, and subconsciously fought against Nyx by wishing to keep living. This general human desire became the **collective unconscious**, creating Shadows, but also granting a select few the ability to summon Personas<sup>[1]</sup>.

As history went by, shards of Nyx's flesh fell onto Earth: coined **Plumes of Dusk** as they look vaguely like feathers. They contain the energy of spirit itself, and are used throughout the series to grant artificial life. When first discovered by the then-head of Kirijo Group in the 80s-90s, it prompted a huge wave of research into the previously unknown world of Personas and Shadows. They learned soon of **the Fall**, the end of the world ushered by Nyx, and of the Death Arcana that would usher her.

Seeking deliverance, Kirijo group scientists gathered as many Shadows as possible in order to fuse them into their various Greater Arcana forms, and then those twelve into Death itself. In 1999, they succeeded, but were thwarted by one of the lead scientists mid-fusion. This incomplete version of Death ran away, before being stopped by Aigis, an Anti-Shadow weapon (granted life and a Persona with Plumes of Dusk).

Aigis couldn't defeat Death, but she could seal him away. She bound his essence into a 6/7 year old Makoto nearby, one who had just lost his family in a car wreck during this confrontation.
