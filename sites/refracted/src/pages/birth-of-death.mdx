description: "Nyx, and her gift of Death"
---
Before humanity, there was an entity known as Nyx, the Planet Eater, who crashed into Earth and was split apart in spirit and body. Her spirit remained in the main chunk of the earth, while her physical form mixed with the fractured chunks of Earth to create the moon. In fact, her spirit gave the then-single celled and functionally immortal lifeforms the ability to die over the course of time.

But, her spirit also expedited the evolutionary process: particularly in what would become humanity. Humans formed psyches and consciousnesses, they gained the ability to think and feel for themselves in a way beyond just instinct. They learned to fear death, and subconsciously fought against Nyx by wishing to keep living. This general human desire became the **collective unconscious**, creating Shadows, but also granting a select few the ability to summon Personas.
