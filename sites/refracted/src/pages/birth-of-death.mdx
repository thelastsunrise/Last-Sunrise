description: "Nyx, and her gift of Death"
---
Before recorded history, there was an entity known as Nyx, the Planet Eater, who crashed into Earth and was split apart in spirit and body. Her spirit remained in the main chunk of the earth, while her physical form mixed with the fractured chunks of Earth to create the moon. Naturally, her presence expedited the death rates of every living thing on the planet.

Despite physically killing the world, her spirit fractured into smaller bits through the minds of every living thing; giving them awareness of their own death. Whether it was humans or a species earlier in their evolutionary chain, the people of the world began to fear death, and subconsciously fought against Nyx by wishing to live. This general human desire became the **Collective Unconscious**, and granted humanity the ability to summon Personas and form Shadows.
