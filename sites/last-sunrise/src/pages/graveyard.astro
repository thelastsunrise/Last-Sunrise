    <SectionOneColumn>
        <p>Below is a list of pages I've decided to delete from the main website for any number of reasons.</p>
        <p>Perhaps delete isn't the best choice of words, every link below is at least mostly functional. For one, I believe in media preservation over my own distaste for some of these pages. If some hypothetical person might be able to learn from dissecting my code, understanding the choices I made and how I've learned since, that's all the reason I need. Besides, it's kind of fun to look down at memory lane sometimes.</p>
        <p>Be warned, the pages below will be laggy, awkwardly designed, horribly inaccessible and almost completely unresponsive. I've done what I can to make them at least somewhat viewable on whatever device, but there's only so much that <em>can</em> be done.</p>

            <p><b>Cause of death:</b> The crime of iframes and boring design</p>
                <p><b>Dates active:</b> Feb 22, 2023 to June 1, 2023</p>
                <p>A mess and a half that used iframes of all things for the sidebars and footers I did not want to comb through every page to update. This was a page made by a version of me who thought they knew everything about webdev because they spent their childhood editing OC profiles. Naturally, I was humbled, and quickly moved onto v2 with everything I learned here.</p>

        <ImageCardWide imgSrc={v2Screenie} imgAlt="A screenshot of the version 2 index" linkTo="/graveyard/index-v2">
            <p><b>Cause of death:</b> Messy, hard-to-follow code</p>
            <p><b>Dates active:</b> June 1, 2023 to January 30, 2025</p>
            <p>I love this layout, I really do! In some ways, more than v3's. It's a really unique design with lots of fun color choices and it's one of my favorites out of my own graphic design works. This was when I finally let myself use bootstrap for the sake of responsiveness and then... I gave up on making it responsive after realizing how horrible it'd be to redraw 5 versions of all my assets. Ultimately, there was just way too much going on for it to be any fun for me to update, so I hit the bricks for a year and left most of the pages blank.</p>

        <ImageCardWide imgSrc={v2BlogScreenie} imgAlt="A screenshot of the V2 Blog layout" linkTo="/graveyard/v2-blog">
            <p><b>Cause of death:</b> Too jarring compared to the rest of the site</p>
            <p><b>Dates active:</b> June 13, 2023 to November 29, 2023</p>
            <p>I still like the idea behind this one--where I wanted to harken to how Neocities/web 1.0 style sites have totally different stylesheets for different pages. It was fun at the time but... I don't know it feels weird and bad now. I'm not too huge a fan of getting my eyes blasted for something supposed to be readable like a blog, especially when it contrasts so heavily with the global color scheme!</p>

        <ImageCardWide imgSrc={wcnScreenie} imgAlt="A screenshot of the What Comes Next? D&D campaign page" linkTo="/graveyard/wcn">
            <p><b>Cause of death:</b> Memories of a bad time in my life</p>
            <p><b>Dates active:</b> October 26, 2023 to November 7, 2023</p>
            <p>This was a page made for a D&D campaign I ran my freshman year of college. I like the page design a lot! I really mastered the art of putting image assets into CSS (I'm still very proud of those corner pieces). Unfortunately, this page suffers the same issue as the rest of v2--the code is far too bloated to be usable. Not to mention the art style is very...unfitting of the vibes I was going for.</p>
