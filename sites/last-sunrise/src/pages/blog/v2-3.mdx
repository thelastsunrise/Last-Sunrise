#### MGS Shrine

Something I've noticed about my webdev workflow is I tend to spend a bit too much time perfecting each page before launching it, which would be great if I did this for a living! But at the end of the day this is just a hobby project, and one I use to decompress when life gets rough. My point with this being, it's gotten to the point where I stress so much over making each update perfect that it's starting to make this project a chore, which is the last thing in the world I want!

All this means that I'm going try and take a new approach to these updates. Every shrine doesn't need to be its own elaborate fansite, if something breaks it's a breeze to go back through and fix it. This shrine is me trying to unlearn that perfectionism... at least as much as I can. It's by no means my favorite part of this site, but even then I'm really happy with it! I'm proud of how I managed to keep it all to one landing page, and how I built it with expansion in mind without it being a project I tackle all at once.

I jumped right into the code for this page...mostly at least. I tried writing out the text contents before anything, which helped a lot with pushing out of those slumps of staring at my screen trying to figure out what a section could possibly be used for. From there I drew a very quick layout, more focused on color than anything. It took me a while to figure out what I even wanted the page to look like.

In the end I settled with a codec-inspired color scheme, perhaps in the future I'll experiment with themes (I still have the code lying around from early v2.0...).

There's lots of fixes and mini-updates to come with this shrine; actually publishing that article I started, as well as adding some deco around the page expanding the outlinks section, and most importantly making an actual fanart gallery.

On that note, I snagged the code for the gallery masonry from here. I'll experiment with it some more in the near future to differentiate it more from the source & tailor it more for this site, but I highly reccommend giving that article a read if you're interested in a pure CSS masonry grid!
