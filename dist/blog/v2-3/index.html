<p>Something I’ve noticed about my webdev workflow is I tend to spend a bit too much time perfecting each page before launching it, which would be great if I did this for a living! But at the end of the day this is just a hobby project, and one I use to decompress when life gets rough. My point with this being, it’s gotten to the point where I stress so much over making each update perfect that it’s starting to make this project a chore, which is the last thing in the world I want!</p>
<p>All this means that I’m going try and take a new approach to these updates. Every shrine doesn’t need to be its own elaborate fansite, if something breaks it’s a breeze to go back through and fix it. This shrine is me trying to unlearn that perfectionism… at least as much as I can. It’s by no means my favorite part of this site, but even then I’m really happy with it! I’m proud of how I managed to keep it all to one landing page, and how I built it with expansion in mind without it being a project I tackle all at once.</p>

<p>I jumped right into the code for this page…mostly at least. I tried writing out the text contents before anything, which helped a lot with pushing out of those slumps of staring at my screen trying to figure out what a section could possibly be used for. From there I drew a very quick layout, more focused on color than anything. It took me a while to figure out what I even wanted the page to look like.</p>
<p>In the end I settled with a codec-inspired color scheme, perhaps in the future I’ll experiment with themes (I still have the code lying around from early v2.0…).</p>

I just love the colors and blocky motifs on this UI!</p> </figcaption> </div>
<p>There’s lots of fixes and mini-updates to come with this shrine; actually publishing that article I started, as well as adding some deco around the page expanding the outlinks section, and most importantly making an actual fanart gallery.</p>
<p>On that note, I snagged the code for the gallery masonry from here. I’ll experiment with it some more in the near future to differentiate it more from the source &amp; tailor it more for this site, but I highly reccommend giving that article a read if you’re interested in a pure CSS masonry grid!</p>  </section>  </main> </div> <div class="row"> <footer class="col-12 text-center"> <div> <p>Last Sunrise est. 2023 &#9734 Last updated <span></span></p> <p><a href="/sitemap">Sitemap</a> &#10023; <a href="/copyright">Copyright</a> &#10023; <a href="/rss">RSS</a> &#10023; <a href="mailto:cat@lastsunrise.art">Email</a></p> </div> </footer> <div class="footer-filler"></div> </div> </body></html>
