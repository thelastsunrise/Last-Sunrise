Twins were a lot more than Salim and Miguel were ready for, they soon realized. Balancing their careers, the myriad bills that came in each season, expanding the house for the kids, and all their other outside obligations left no time for them to spend real time together, or even decompress alone. Salim came clean to Miguel one day that he was afraid one day he'd find someone else and run away, and Miguel realized he didn't really know this man at all.

Miguel's depression spiraled and spiraled, he developed anxiety, paranoia, and started having days where he couldn't get out of bed. He started getting hateful texts from one of his former directors, managed to go missing one night (he was very dazed the next day, something about aliens?) and Salim knew they needed outside help.

They went to their first counseling session together, and were advised that sending Elmira and Etan to daycare was not a bad thing, especially if it meant their dads wouldn't resent them and each other later. And with all the free time scheduled care for the kids would afford them, they should spend it finally sitting down and getting to know each other.

They made it a goal to go out on a date at least twice every week. Salim realized, as messed up as it was, the wealth imbalance between him and Miguel that initially attracted him wasn't there anymore, and beyond the obligation of being there for their kids, he wasn't all too attracted to Miguel anymore. For Miguel, he wasn't really attracted to Salim at all beyond the whirlwind of gratefulness that he didn't have to be on the streets anymore. It was hard to try and find that spark again (if it was ever even there?) but they tried, and at the very least have a blast hanging out with each other, even if it doesn't feel very romantic right now.

It wasn't perfect, if it ever could be, but things were alright. Regardless of where they stood with each other, they loved their kids dearly (even if they were extremely annoying 99% of the time between Elmira's fussiness and Etan's clinginess). When Winterfest rolled around, the family threw a small, private party and exchanged presents. The twins felt alright about their matching diaries, but loved the Zatar Manakeesh Salim threw together for everyone.

Soon after, the kids' birthday rolled around. Their party had to be cancelled due to the Windenburg government shutting down the local power for 12 hours on zero notice, which made everyone quite miserable. But, even with no oven to bake a cake and no cell service to invite anyone over, they had a nice time showing their dads how to play Stack The Block, at least.

Their birthday present being a new set of rooms for the each of them was pretty cool at least.

After their first day at elementary school, Elmira came home talking about how she stopped a bully from harassing her new friend, while Etan immediately bolted into his room to do homework. It seemed the twins pretty quickly settled into a "quiet nerdy boy" and "socialite girl" archetype, much to the amusement of their gay fathers.
