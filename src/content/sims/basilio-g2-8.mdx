With all his newfound time, Salim spent his retirement getting into yoga and other meditative practices. Something that itched at the back of his mind was how he could never find enough time to do all the things he wanted; there was always a new book idea, or a new medical complication, and never enough time to do all of that and still spend time with his family. So, he turned to wellness in an effort to find peace with the dwindling time he has left.

Etan finally pulled the strings they needed to and opened up a veterinary clinic in Newcrest. Named, of course, Basilio Pet-erinary Clinic. Its beginnings were anything but humble, costing an investment of 100k Simoleons and immediately staffing 3 vets alongside Etan himself.

This little kitty was actually perfectly healthy, and just needed a vaccination. A very peaceful first client all things considered.

Elmira, on the much more soap opera-y end of the spectrum, realized very quickly after the morning sickness hit that she was pregnant. Doba was the first to get the news, and the two quickly started organizing his move into the Basilio House. 

During all the chaos of moving him in, Elmira broke the news to her fathers and Etan, to everyone's absolute delight. The shock of the announcement after they'd only just gotten together was probably helped by the very cute cat Doba brought in with him, Cosmo.

I'm actually obsessed with him look how little he is...

With everything going well, and with the two of them already locked in with child on the way, Elmira decided to take Doba out to the prettiest park in Innisgreen to seal the deal:

He said yes!

The months came and went, Elmira was diagnosed with Preeclampsia, but managed to scrape by without any serious complications disrupting the pregnancy or her greater health.

The big day came, with a new nursery built and ready for the baby (thanks to many sweet gifts from a baby shower). Beyond Elmira needing a C-section (something she'd expected after the Preeclampsia diagnosis) and Doba going into a furied haze in a panicked/concerned daze and bolting out the hospital, the birth went smoothly. The Basilios were ready to welcome their third generation through their new baby girl, Ajei Basilio.

Except, when Doba finally calmed down, and the two of them were able to get home with Ajei in tow, something wasn't right. Miguel was outside, wringing his hands around nervously. He stopped them in their tracks and said Salim was dead. The Reaper already took him.

He died peacefully and alone inside the bathroom. Miguel was in the bedroom, and only found out when Salim had already been taken.

In a collective shocked haze, and Etan wasn't even home from work yet, Elmira put Ajei to bed and tried to think of anything to do next.
