Unsurprisingly, Elmira's Cupid's Corner werewolf hunt went terribly. Turns out if there are any werewolf bachelors in town, none of them are signed up for any dating apps. She did, however, meet a guy she was actually really into, **Sawyer Snow**, a creative, outdoorsy photographer. They went out on a few dates, and got along phenomenally, to the point where they'd even talked about moving in together.

It felt almost too perfect, he liked all the same things she did, they both wanted to start a family at some point down the line, he would happily go on jogs and gym trips with her, and he even got along with the rest of her family. But something about that made Elmira uncomfortable. He was too affectionate. He would call her to check in too often and was somehow too respectful of her boundaries. She felt stuck and embarassed for feeling that way over a textbook perfect relationship and didn't know what else to do.

All he did was make one comment about not wanting to talk about his jobhunting situation right now.

During one of their many dates, and on one of Elmira's worse anxiety days, she completely blew up at Sawyer the first chance she got. Arguments were traded about the job market, how she at least works cleaning a gym and he hasn't even applied for one photography studio yet. He retorted back with complaints about how she never asks him what's going on, why he's been struggling to find a job at all, or anything else. She broke up with him right then and there.

Elmira, at least, knew she was in the wrong for this whole situation, but felt so disgusted at herself for not knowing why she was so compelled to lash out and break things off. Her therapist suggested it might have something to do with attachment styles, but the thing that really stuck out to her was a comment about aromanticism...

She knew, of course, that not everyone experienced romantic attraction. But she had no idea it was a spectrum, and always thought she was too interested in the idea of dating for that to be a category she fell into. At the very least it explained why she felt so put off by the thought of being in a functional relationship, even if she was attracted to Sawyer on paper. It also explained her random obsession with werewolves and the idyllic, fantastical relationship one would give her.

But still, actually reaching out and apologizing wasn't a thought she was considering. Especially after seeing some pictures credited to his name in her favorite fashion magazine.

She deleted Cupid's Corner, and decided to focus on herself for a while.

Etan, on the other hand, had it much quieter. He completely failed his second semester at Foxbury, and with the support of his own therapist, decided to drop out and work on his own studies. Luckily, he had the financial blanket to experiment for a while, and see what would be good for him. In the bits of time he was able to talk about it with them, Salim and Miguel were supportive of the idea too.

Bailey, who grew up shockingly fast, was there with Etan every step of the way.

He found that caring for Bailey came really easily to him, he gave him the energy to leave his room on the depressive days (how could he say no to walking that cute little face!) and the restraint to not make impulsive, life-altering decisions on the manic ones.

One of his favorite things to do was tinker around in the kitchen making new flavors of treat for Bailey. When he discovered a home-veterinary lab kit, he bought it immediately and started researching all he could on professional pet care. Maybe it'd be easier to try university again with a real goal in mind, but he discovered it was possible to start working as a vet assistant without actively being a student or a college grad. He jumped to that chance, starting with some 10 or so hours a week while he still had most of his time off to recover, and felt pretty good for the first time in a long while.
