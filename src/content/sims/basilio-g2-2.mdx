As the twins Etan and Elmira's birthdays came and went, Salim and Miguel finally scheduled them appointments to get vaccinations and regular check-ups; a decision spurred by Elmira's complaints of her throat feeling "weird and icy" whenever the house went too long without a vacuuming.

To no one's surprise, Elmira came home with a brand new asthma diagnosis.

Beyond Elmira coming home with a new inhaler, everyone's health seemed well. Aside from Elmira inheriting half of Salim's weak immune system, the family seemed extremely healthy, and would only have to worry about their regular check-ups.

Miguel's acting career began taking off, after he began being known as a Seasoned Thespian of the industry, he was finally able to leave the sketchy, AI-run agency he'd been with since he started in Windenburg. He even managed to secure a lead role in a very popular sitcom reboot.

Salim's journalist job stagnated on the other hand, but his personally published works were taking off. While he hadn't hit any bestsellers yet, he was able to write a book every month, netting the family about 3k simoleons every week (which was a blessing, considering how inconsistent acting could be).

While they were still growing into themselves, Etan excelled at school, netting A's with every assignment, and dutifully working on every project assigned to him. He even spent a lot of his free time outside of classwork tinkering with a science table Salim had bought him with his new room.

The kid's going places for sure.

Elmira, on the other hand, wasn't necessarily *failing* at school, but she didn't seem to care all too much about it. Instead, she spent most of her time in class making new friends and exchanging the friendship bracelets she spent most of her free time crafting.

And this kid's going to different places. Her social ability is impressive, nonetheless.

But, things still weren't perfect. One night the burgular alarms went off while Salim was the only adult home, and the kids were fast asleep. The police didn't make it in time, but Salim tackled the burgular and, despite losing, was thankfully able to scare them off the lot before anything was taken.

He was embarassed for a long while after this, but Etan and Elmira still thought it was the coolest thing that he tackled the burgular like a *superhero*.

Miguel, on the other hand, went to urgent care immediately after he finished filming *A Painting of a Duke* for the day due to a particularly bad migraine spell. He was diagnosed with hypertension and prescribed beta blockers to make it a little bit more manageable.

Miguel took the news badly, to say the least, especially after coming home to Salim covered in bruises with two very scared kids. He didn't want Etan or Elmira to deal with this. He didn't want the rest of his life to be spent afraid that his blood pressure teetered too high and that he wouldn't be there to see the twins grow up. He spiraled into a full-on midlife crisis where he obsessively began creating artworks, so he'd leave behind at least something.

Not the worst coping mechanism, all things considered.

The days came and went, the twins graduating middle school, aging up to teens and beginning high school. Etan became obsessed with dogs, while Elmira started becoming obsessed with working out.

And on the side during all of this, a new family moved in across the street from the Basilios...

Some new family named the Simpsons. No one has met them yet. Sorry breaking author voice to say my friends made me do this and I think it's funny enough and also close enough to the main cast to bring up. Anyways.
