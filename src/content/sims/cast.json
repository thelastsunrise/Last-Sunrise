                            "College life was not for Etan, something he couldn't understand because education came so easily for him before. Elmira encouraged him to talk to a therapist before another D made him completely break down, where he was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and was told that his dads were actually neglectful, whether maliciously or not. Struggling desperately to reconcile with the fact that he was burnt out, he adopted an emotional support dog, a Saint Bernard named Bailey, and took some time off at home, where he discovered a love for veterinary work."},

They realized they were nonbinary, came out to their twin sister, and was doing great at the vet clinic (enough to be promoted to assistant manager and to comfortably work full time.) But still, Etan felt like they could be doing something more still, and started setting their sights to opening their own veterinary practice. Unfortunately, their father, Salim, passed away shortly after those dreams started becoming a reality, right after their sister gave birth to a new niece."}

Instead, he spent his time getting into urban exploration, digging through abandoned buildings just for the fun of it. But, he pushed his luck too far, and one night was bitten by...something he couldn't catch a sight of. That something turned out to be a werewolf, passing its curse along to him. Horrified of what he'd become, Doba ran away, moving as far as he could with the money he could scrape, to try and find a cure for himself."},

They hit it off immediately when they finally met in person, and Doba knew he was in love. When he came clean about the truth of his...interest in werewolves, Elmira accepted him brazenly, admitting she liked him even more because of it. He moved into the Basilio house very shortly after that, with his newly adopted cat, Cosmo, after learning Elmira was pregnant."}
