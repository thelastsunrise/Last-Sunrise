The year's end was uneventful, though it became much more eventful the second Year 4 began. Elmira and George were...fine. They became official a little bit before New Years Day, and that was really it. When she saw him throwing his arm around an uncomfortable Celia during the party Elmira was throwing for them, though... she broke up with him right then and there, and kicked him the hell out.

Poor girl....

The breakup was fortunately not too hard on Elmira, helped by the realization that she wasn't into him at *all* after some hindsight. She was just embarrassed, more than anything. But she found peace in trashy werewolf romance novels. A werewolf boyfriend would never cheat on her with her best friend. A werewolf boyfriend would shred anyone who hurt her and the people she loved apart.

Etan, on the other hand, started his first semester as a Biology major in Foxbury University. He'd won every scholarship he applied for and had the next four years settled for free. But for whatever reason, he couldn't keep up in the way he used to be able to. Even opening his homework each day was a struggle, and he spent that semester coming in with half-baked assignments, projects and presentations.

He couldn't even muster the energy to tinker with things around the house like he used to. He found himself becoming scared of even going outside most days. He got snappy with his fathers and sister, would hide in his locked room, horrified they'd want to kick him out of the house, and generally just felt...wrong and off.

On one of his better days, he confided in Elmira about it, and they agreed to start going to therapy together (Elmira didn't feel like she needed it, but the thought of her going too made Etan more comfortable with the thought of getting help).

But, before those first appointments, the twins celebrated their birthdays and became adults!

and Etan Basilio!

And after those first appointments, the twins realized their childhoods were... not great at all, actually. Both of them were told that it was not exactly normal to have a butler thrown onto you because your parents are too busy writing/acting and otherwise being famous. 

Their relationships with Miguel and Salim were good, they felt comfortable going to them when an issue came up or if they needed advice, but they didn't realize how absent they were after they started high school, when they were already starting to get kind of flaky as soon as they started elementary school. 

In lieu of this, Elmira was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Etan with Borderline Personality Disorder. While it sucked to think about the treatment they'd need to get (especially Etan), it was as reassuring as it was overwhelming realizing their quirks growing up were symptoms of neglect.

At the very least, they were getting started on the process of making life bearable for themselves. Etan was able to welcome his new emotional support animal, Bailey, a tiny Saint Bernard puppy into the household soon after his diagnosis.

Look at how tiny he is!!!

And on the side, Elmira started getting really into tracking down werewolves on Cupid's Corner...
