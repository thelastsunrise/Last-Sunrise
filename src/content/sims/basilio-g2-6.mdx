Things were pretty stable for the Basilios in the time after Etan and Elmira started therapy. Elmira was happy focusing on herself for once, spending lots of time in the house's new home gym training for work. Etan was able to make an agreement with his new boss about mental health days, even being given PTO for them. Miguel and Salim aged up to elders a week apart, and were otherwise doing pretty fine.

One day, while bothering him as he was upgrading things on the computer, Elmira asked what Etan's thoughts were on the LGBT community. As a complete joke, considering the two have two fathers. Etan, deadpan, said he was queer.

Once again breaking author voice to say this was a complete shock to all of us in the voice chat. Genuinely we had no idea Etan was any sort of queer until this point. Not once had I pondered on him or anything (assuming he was the embodiment of that 'I'm probably nonbinary but I have a job so I don't really care about that right now' post)

Elmira, stunned that he'd never mentioned anything about this before, asked how so. Etan was actually nonbinary, and was soft launching they/them pronouns for themself. Elmira, of course, congratulated them and promised her forever support no matter what they decide to do (or not do) regarding transition. And also laid into them about not saying a thing while she was going through her greyromantic awakening. Lovingly, but part of her still was upset they'd hold back mentioning something so huge.

On her own side adventures, Elmira met **Doba Claw**, a fellow werewolf enthusiast through some online forums on the matter. Particularly, they were both really into speculative fiction about the curse, and otherwise bonded famously over gym trips and crazy party stories. Elmira could imagine a relationship with him, but was entirely content just being friends with him as well.

Doba was new to the area when he and Elmira first started chatting.

Most importantly, Doba got along very well with the whole family, even Etan (as diametrically opposite as they were. Perhaps in part because he was so similar to Elmira).

Miguel, on the other hand, started experiencing the various symptoms of old age soon after his birthday. Nothing severe enough for a hospital visit or formal diagnosis, but enough for the team of *A Painting of a Duke* to start writing him off of the show. He'd started flubbing his lines, forgetting what the scripts said and expecting the directors to accomodate for that. That was manageable, he brought the show enough revenue for his difficulty to be justified; it was when he'd start passing out on set that the decision was made.
