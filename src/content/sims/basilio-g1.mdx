Meet **Miguel Basilio**, a loving and sociable Sim with a dream to make it big as an actor. He might put his hand on your shoulder or enthusiastically shake your hand as he asks your name and gushes about how it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. But once you lock eyes, something tells you that sunny smile is just another show put on for the world.

Interestingly, his monolid eyes are purple.">
Everyone say hi Miguel!

Miguel was evicted from his family home after coming out to his parents. At the same time, he won a giveaway for a huge plot of land at Windenburg's Dresden Crescent. With nowhere else to go and not a dime to his name, he decided to start over.

Unfortunately for him, the land he'd won was completely empty. In the dead of winter. Despite having the deed in his name, he was functionally homeless and had to live out of the community's library, cafes and gym so he wouldn't freeze to death before securing an acting gig.

This poor guy.

Things got boring real fast. But at least he was free to be himself. Miguel signed up for Cupid's Corner and managed to score a date with a certain **Logan Morales**. Their first date at the Strangerville nudist IHOP went superb. While Miguel wasn't totally sure if they should go steady yet, Logan wasn't shy in his affections for Miguel.

<BlogImage imgSrc="../../../images/shrines/sims/basiliox1-ihopdate.png" imgAlt="A Sims 4 screenshot, taken in a restuarant where Miguel Basilio is naked, Logan is looking at him while speaking, and there's a popup in the corner about a swarm of bees descending upon Miguel.">
It went well, until Miguel took off all his clothes and was immediately attacked by a swarm of bees.

With his body caked in bee stings, and a phone call about some **Hatsune Miku** being found frozen to death (he was unsure why they had his number, but he wished her household well), Miguel decided to call it a night. Logan kissed his cheek and asked for a second date. Miguel smiled and said probably.

After a cold night sleeping on library couches, and on the morning of his first gig, Miguel gets a call from Logan:

<BlogImage imgSrc="../../../images/shrines/sims/basiliox1-deathomen.png" imgAlt="A Sims 4 screenshot, a UI of a call between Miguel and Logan, saying 'I had a dream about you last night. You were being followed by Grim! He kept looking down at his Slablet, and then looking at you...at least I think he was looking at you. I don't think he actually had a face. Whatever. That doesn't matter, what matters is that I think I might be psychic, so this is serious. You're in danger, my friend!'">
Weird, but alright.

And on his way to the gig...

<BlogImage imgSrc="../../../images/shrines/sims/basiliox1-heygrim.png" imgAlt="A Sims 4 screenshot, a UI of the Grim Reaper calling.">
Which could mean nothing.

Miguel shut down his phone and ignored it so he could get his first paycheck and hopefully sleep on a bed tonight. Logan was almost *definitely* psychic and that weirded him the hell out.

But, that out of sight out of mind mindset paid off, because Miguel came home with 500 simoleons, a call from a mysterious benefactor to meet in a hotel room a few towns over, 500 more simoleons, and could go to bed not only with a real mattress beneath him, but a used refrigerator too!

<BlogImage imgSrc="../../../images/shrines/sims/basiliox1-amimir.png" imgAlt="A Sims 4 screenshot, Miguel sleeping in a patchwork bed with the rustiest fridge ever next to him.">
Walls didn't come with the purchase, unfortunately.

The days flew by now that Miguel had an eighth of a house. With gigs coming left and right, a ridiculous amount of missed calls from Logan, and a blossoming friendship with his recurring Director, **Waluigi Wah**, Miguel felt alright for the first time in years. He could afford a shower, four walls, and enough to even eat out once in a while. The new year came, and Miguel resolved to finally get a significant other, maybe Logan maybe not.

One night, he woke up with a knife to his throat and was dragged outside. By the time he could call the police, everything in his home was gone and the police could only pat him on the back.

Breaking narrator voice here to say I said out loud on call "Could you imagine if Miguel had a burgular come" and then this happened 5 minutes later. Unbelievable.

He lived out of the same library, cafes and gyms he did 4 months ago. The staff smiled and gave him discounts as they could. Gigs were sparse and everything seemed hopeless. Miguel even considered moving back in with his parents (living a lie was better than whatever this was). He ghosted Logan and lived off of the meager tips from performing fake romances on the street.

Late spring on Love Day, he got a text message from an unknown number claiming to be his secret admirer. With nothing to lose, Miguel said sure and was quickly introduced to a **Salim Benali** on his doorstep.

<BlogImage imgSrc="../../../images/shrines/sims/basiliox1-salimprofile.png" imgAlt="A Sims 4 screenshot, the CAS screen for Salim Benali, who wears dark clothing, has dark brown hair in a low, messy bun, a trimmed full beard, kind brown eyes and mid-light russet skin.">

Miguel, a little baffled, formally introduced himself to Salim. He asked what exactly interested him so much. Salim said he's not into men. Then, he kissed Miguel and asked him to be official. Miguel said sure, why not. Salim got down on one knee and asked him to marry him. Miguel said sure, why not. Salim hugged Miguel to his chest and asked him if they could move in together. Miguel, ears perked this time, said sure, why not.

Much later, Miguel asked Salim why him. Why did he move so quickly. How did he know. Salim laughed, cradled him closer, and said he was into helping broke people out.

Living together goes great for the next couple months, and the pair get married in a questionably planned wedding at Media Naranja in Ciudad Enamorada. They speak their vows and kiss for the first time outside of the public restroom. Their invited guests state they didn't see the newlyweds once.

A happy wedding. Unseen is Logan slapping Miguel across the face for cheating on him. They were never together.

The months continue on. Miguel experiences financial security for the first time in his life as Salim brings his weekly sci-fi novel royalties and all of his old furniture. They build a small house together where Salim can keep publishing his works, and Miguel can practice his acting. In the autumn, after more wrong-number texts about people dying (**Neil Watts**, who died in a rock climbing accident, and **Blake Galad**, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances) they decide not to waste a second and start a family.

At the laboratory, the scientist hands them a pair of twins, a girl named Elmira Basilio and a boy named Etan Basilio.
