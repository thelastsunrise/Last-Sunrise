High school was pretty normal for Etan and Elmira. Etan excelled, and actually did so well in school that after the twins rose from freshmen to sophomores, he was offered an early graduation and a few scholarships for university!

Elmira was more preoccupied with making new friends and sneaking off to college parties. Despite her tendency for adventure, her grades were alright, and she seemed pretty well, so Salim and Miguel weren't particularly worried so long as she continued to stay safe. 

Clearly, Elmira wasn't the one to be worried about. Right before his diploma could be delivered, Etan managed to set the 13,000 simoleon stove on fire permanently traumatizing himself and his sister.

Womp womp.

The fire was, fortunately, very contained and handled with ease. Still, Salim's books had been selling incredibly well, and Miguel's show had been taking off. The family decided to start rennovating the house, expanding the front with an actual lounge, guest bathroom, reading nook, and garage. The dust problem had gotten to be too much for Elmira's asthma as well, so they tacked on a butler's quarters in the back.

Despite outwardly doing pretty fine after the incident, Etan went to urgent care after some dizzy spells and was diagnosed with Anemia. And yet still undeterred, he applied for university. The wait drove him nuts enough that one day he came home with a delivery truck in tow, and hauled out some rocket ship building supplies Phineas and Ferb style.

He's like 15 by the way.

Elmira was finally able to schedule a keg party to celebrate Etan escaping high school after finals started winding down, inviting all of their (correction, just her) friends.

It's just juice don't even worry about it guys. No their dads were not aware of this party. Don't worry about it. Etan also was definitely not dropped immediately after this photo was taken. I will say it again-

Winterfest rolled around, Salim was admitted to the hospital that week for appendicitis, and Miguel was out most of the time either visiting him or working on his show. Elmira decided she liked this throwing her own parties thing and put together a small party with a couple of her closest friends (Celia Sadya and George Laurent) and Etan. The four spend the night playing board games and chatting, Celia tells Elmira she has a crush on Etan, and Elmira says she might like George. Both of them decide to go for it...

Clearly it went pretty well with Elmira and George!

Etan, on the other hand, picked up zero of Celia's clues and thanked her for being such a caring friend.

Salim came home later that week, sore and dazed but feeling alright. Elmira excitedly told him all about George and everything else he'd missed while he was gone. Salim was happy for her, but Miguel was still nervous that George didn't have her best interests in mind, so the two agreed that he'd tag along on exactly one date of theirs.

Unfortunately, Miguel passed out on the cafe couch for the entire date and didn't want to admit it, so he gave Elmira the thumbs up and decided she was old enough to make her own decisions.

Speaking of Miguel, on the side of all of this kept having things go wrong. Not once, but twice was he kidnapped again by aliens, and in a completely separate incident had to go to the emergency room after choking on a vegan BLT. Along with all of this, the town of Windenberg has decided he's the recipient for all death announcements, having to report himself that **Robert Lin**, **Quincy Reynard**, **Eva Flex** (n√©e Rosalene) and **Waluigi Wah** had passed away of old age.

But, he'd found it becoming easier and easier every day to handle these crazy twists and turns, and same with Salim. The two weren't quite sure still if their relationship was platonic or romantic, but they knew they were happy with this arrangement and were okay not having an answer. The year came and went.
