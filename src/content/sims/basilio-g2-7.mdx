On the night of the Moonlight Revelry, Doba called Elmira asking her to meet him at midnight on a beach in Sulani. Expecting a love confession (and not really sure what to do about that if so), Elmira went out to see what it was all about. The absolute last thing she could have possibly expected (though it really should have been higher on the list) was to see him there in the sand, hunched over and panting, wolf-like ears swivelling back as Elmira's footsteps grew closer.

In which Elmira punches the air and goes "YESS YESYEYSYESS SYAYYYY YAYYY HIP HIP HOORAAAYYY!!!!!! I mean what are you okay?"

Doba, barely holding on as the fury consumed him, told Elmira about how he moved here after he realized he contracted the curse. His interest in werewolf speculative fiction was because he was trying to find any sort of lead to a cure. He couldn't share much more, though, because the fury took over and he had to run off before doing something out of his control.

Elmira, normal about this, called Doba the next day asking him to come over immediately.

Literally the best day of her life.

After all of that, they sat down and spoke for a bit. Doba admitted he'd had feelings for Elmira as early as when they'd met. Elmira laughed, and was frank to him. She told him about her greyromanticism, about the weirdness of her last relationships. How she was really, *really* into the fact that he was a werewolf. But she also felt...different about him. That their relationship was more than just her trying to date a guy, and that his friendship was still the most important thing to her.

No comment.

Doba agreed with the fact that they were friends above everything, and was relieved she wasn't scared off by this part of him. They agreed to talk about the relationship thing another time, while Elmira wasn't reeling from this reveal and Doba wasn't still riding out the shock of her support.

On the complete other side of all of this, Miguel finally finished his last day of filming and was officially retired! Salim, who'd retired a little bit before him, threw a tiny celebration for just the two of them to welcome finally having personal freedom.

I don't have anything to say about this screenshot I just thought it was really cute...

With the twins hitting 30 that week, the weight of the unspoken conversation about Miguel and Salim's unintentional neglect hung unspoken in the air as Etan started looking towards bigger things, and Elmira started getting hit with morning sickness...
